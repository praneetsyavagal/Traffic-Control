1) remove some useless and harmful actions (like all reds, vehicles colliding) (tried)
2) solve the simulation reopening problem
3) change the route file such that all lanes have some incoming and outgoing vehicles 
4) try to change phase duration and hyperparameters  (maybe stack another layer) 
5) write further code to always be greedy after training   (tried)
6) obtain statistics for round robin & RL for comparing
7) why not directly feed s1_vec to network?
